/**
 * Help object for handling blockwise request.
 * This object is a helper for CoAP server handlers that support BLOCK1 blockwise transfers
 * (i.e PUT or POST requests with large payloads) or BLOCK2 blockwise transfers
 * (i.e GET request with large payloads).
 * This object maintains the current state of a blockwise transfer.
 * This includes the next expected request's block offset,
 * as well as an ETag value used to differentiate between different transfers.
 * Only one transfer can be active at a time.
 * When a request is received, the helper can check if the request is a resent request
 * (the block range is just before the current one) or a new request for the next block.
 *
 * A typical use for this helper is:
 * In the OnRequest() method of a CoAP server handler, when a request is received, call
 * GG_CoapBlockwiseServerHelper_OnRequest() to analyze the request and check that it
 * matches the current expectations. If that method returns an error the handler should
 * terminate and return that error. Otherwise, the handler should check if the requested
 * block is the first block (block 0) of a new transfer (`helper.block_info.offset == 0`).
 * If it is a new transfer, the handler should set the helper's ETag value to differentiate
 * this new transfer from previous ones, by calling GG_CoapBlockwiseServerHelper_SetEtag().
 *
 * NOTE: unfortunately, there's no way to differentiate a new request for block 0 and
 * a retransmitted block 0 request, because for block 0, the ETag value isn't yet known to
 * the client. But that isn't an issue in general, because a retransmitted block 0 would
 * simply start a new session just after the one started by the initial block 0 request.
 *
 * Finally, the handler should:
 *   for BLOCK1 PUT/POST transfers, save/handle/process the block's payload if the block
 *   isn't a resent block,
 *   or
 *   for BLOCK2 GET transfers, prepare the block payload to respond with,
 * then call GG_CoapBlockwiseServerHelper_CreateResponse() to create and return a response.
 * (the call to GG_CoapBlockwiseServerHelper_OnRequest() returns a boolean flag that indicates
 *  whether the request is a new request or a resent request).
 *
 * NOTE: the handler must be prepared to receive the same block request more than
 * once, because transmissions may be lost. The helper object will guarantee that
 * the block requests are never out of order or with gaps, but repeated sequential
 * requests for the same block are possible. For PUT/POST requests, simply ignoring resent
 * blocks is usually sufficient. For GET requests, the handler may want to cache the last
 * returned block if it can't re-generate the block payload.
