Getting Started
===============

To get started, you'll first need to [obtain a copy of the project](#cloning-the-project-with-git) 
by cloning the Git repo, or another method, if you haven't already done so. 
Then [setup your build environment](#setting-up-your-build-environment), 
and finally [build](#building) the libraries, examples, tools and unit tests.

Cloning The Project With Git
----------------------------

Clone the project to a location in your filesystem, and update the submodules.
For example, to clone the project in your home directory:

### macOS/Linux
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Fitbit/golden-gate ~/golden-gate
$ cd ~/golden-gate
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Setting Up Your Build Environment
---------------------------------

### Prerequisites

#### macOS

macOS is the recommended platform for working with Golden Gate, as it offers
the most complete build environment, including the ability to build all targets,
run all the examples, and can use the native Bluetooth support.

On a mac running macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or higher, you will need to have at 
a minimum:

  * XCode 11 or higher, including the command-line tools
  * Homebrew - see [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installation instructions
  * Miniconda (or Conda) - see [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macosx-installers) for macOS installation instructions

With those prerequisites installed, you can initialize an environment for
the Golden Gate project.
In a shell window, from the top-level directory of the project, first install 
the homebrew packages by running
``` bash
$ brew bundle
```

Then continue with the instructions for [setting up a `conda` environment](getting_started.md#setting-up-a-conda-environment), below

#### Linux

A Linux host can be used to build all the targets, except iOS.
On a Linux machine, you will need to have at a minimum:

  * Git
  * GCC and G++ (`build_essential` package on Ubuntu or similar)
  * Miniconda (or Conda) - see [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) for Linux installation instructions

#### Docker

If you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system, the 
project includes a `Dockerfile` that you can use to build a docker image.
The resulting docker image contains the minimal set of tools needed to build the 
core libraries, examples, tests and docs.
The easiest way to build the docker image is to use the `invoke` task (if you
have installed `invoke` on your host system):
``` bash
$ inv docker.build
```
You can also build it with other parameters, using the project's `Dockerfile` as
input.

#### Windows

!!! warning "Under construction"
    While the core library does compile and run on Windows, support for that
    platform is currently being re-factored. It isn't functional yet in the 
    current release of the project.

### Setting Up a Conda Environment

Now that you have `conda`, you can create a Conda environment.

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open source package management 
system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. 
Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies.

This project uses Conda to manage the installation and update of a number of
tools and software components that are necessary for building and running the 
software.

Create your `conda` environment by running

``` bash
$ conda env create -n gg
```
This will create a `conda` environment named `gg`.

!!! note "Using a different environment name"
    You can choose a different name for your environment if you wish. 
    We use the name `gg` by default, but you can specify any other name you want 
    when creating the environment by passing that name with the `-n` option of 
    the `conda env create` command

Once your environment is created (which you only need to do once), you can 
activate it by running
``` bash
$ conda activate gg
```

Activate your `gg` environment anytime you want to work with the project. 
Once the environment is activated in a shell, all the tools that are needed to 
build and run the code are in your `PATH`.

!!! tip "Updating you environment"
    If you pull updated versions of the project, you should also update your `gg`
    environment (you don't need to re-create it every time) by running
    ``` bash
    $ conda env update -n gg
    ```

!!! tip "Smoke-testing your environment"
    An easy way to do a basic test to check if your initial environment setup
    has worked, and has been activated, is to try a simple command like:
    ``` bash
    $ inv -l
    ```
    which should list all the tasks that are available through the `invoke`
    task execution system, which you will use later to execute a number of 
    tasks like building and running.

Building
--------

The project uses the [`invoke`](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) task execution 
system to automate a number of tasks, including building the libraries and 
documentation, building and running tests, and more.

### Building For Your Host System

Building for your host system is called a 'native' build. 
CMake is used to generate Makefiles and/or Ninja files (if the Ninja build 
system is installed on your system, which should be the case if you have 
correctly setup and activated your `conda` environment).

Your host system could be a mac running macOS, a machine running Linux, or a
virtual environment running in docker (use `inv docker.run` for an easy way
to start a shell in a docker container, or use a custom invocation of docker
with the docker image for the project, built as explained above).

Run
``` bash
$ inv native.build
```
to build all the core libraries, examples and unit tests for your host system.
The output of the build can be found under `xp/build/cmake/native`.
For example, you should be able to run
``` bash
$ xp/build/cmake/native/apps/stack-tool/gg-stack-tool
```
and see the help for the `gg-stack-tool` command-line tool.

And run
``` bash
$ inv native.test
```
to execute all the unit tests and show the success/failure results.

#### Using XCode on macOS

If your host system is a mac, it is usually convenient to be able to build, 
run and debug from within XCode, rather than on the command line. This is the 
recommended way to work interactively with the project on a mac when you want
to edit/compile/run/debug.

There are two options available

##### Generating An XCode Project Using CMake

First, ensure that you have the XCode command line developer tools installed.
If you're not sure, run:
``` bash
xcode-select --install
```
If the tools were not already installed, you will see something like:
```
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
```
And the installer will kick in (it may take a while).

Then generate the XCode project by running
``` bash
$ inv apple.macos.xp.gen
```
This will generate an XCode project at `xp/build/cmake/xcode-macOS/golden-gate-macos.xcodeproj`.
When you open that project file, you will find build targets for all the libraries,
the command-line tools, the examples, and the unit tests. You can build, run and
debug right from within XCode.

!!! tip
    If you get a CMake error saying `No CMAKE_C_COMPILER could be found`, try 
    ``` bash
    $ sudo xcode-select --reset
    ```
    or, if you want a non-default version of Xcode, use
    ``` bash
    $ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/<Xcode-version>.app>/Contents/Developer
    ```

##### Using The Pre-generated XCode Project

A hand-made XCode project is used to build the framework as well as the 
so-called "Host Application", which is a sample application that illustrates how
to use some of the basic functionality offered by the framework.
See the [Building For iOS](#building-for-ios) paragraph below for details, 
as the same project may be used for macOS as well as iOS.

### Building For Android

See the [Android Platform](platforms/android.md) documentation for instructions 
on how to build the libraries, bindings and sample app for Android.

### Building For iOS

See the [iOS Platform](platforms/ios.md) documentation for instructions 
on how to build the libraries, bindings and sample app for iOS.

### Building For The Pylon Embedded Platform

Pylon is the name used for the project's reference RTOS port. 
In the current version, the Pylon port is a [MyNewt](https://mynewt.apache.org/) 
application running on a [Nordic nRF52840 DK Development Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK).

See the [MyNewt Platform](platforms/mynewt.md) documentation for instructions 
on how to build the libraries, bindings and sample app for MyNewt.

### Building For The Espressif ESP32 Platform

A basic port and sample Bluetooth peripheral application that can run on 
ESP32 processors is included.

See the [ESP32 Platform](platforms/esp32.md) documentation for instructions 
on how to build the libraries and sample app for ESP32.

### Building For Other Platforms

See the [Platforms](platforms/) documentation for more details.

Running Examples
----------------

Depending on your host system, and what targets you have chosen to build,
there are different ways to start running some of the examples.

You can find a few typical example configurations below, but this is by no
means exhaustive. Once you become familiar with the different targets and 
example apps, you can come up with many more ways to setup pairs of communicating
endpoints.  
Also, you can start building your own applications and devices, then many more
options are available to you.

!!! tip "Bluetooth Permissions on macOS"
    On macOS Big Sur and later, applications that use Bluetooth need to be 
    granted permissions to do so. When running the `gg-stack-tool` command line application,
    if your terminal is permissions-aware, like the macOS built-in terminal app, the system
    should prompt you the first time you run `gg-stack-tool`. For other terminals, like iTerm
    for instance, you may need to grant the permission manually, using the system preferences:
    System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> (Privacy Tab) -> (BlueTooth selection on the left), 
    add/enable your terminal application.
    ![macOS Bluetooth Permissions](macos-bluetooth-permissions.jpg){: align=right }

### Host Only

This is the simplest way to start running two instances of a Golden Gate stack
on a single Mac or Linux host, without any dependency on a "real" transport like 
Bluetooth: you simply run two command line applications, each in its own 
shell on your host machine; the two applications communicate with each other
using a local socket.  
See the [Stack Tool](tools/stack_tool.md) documentation for some examples.

### macOS <-> Device

If you have a Nordic nrf52840-DK Development Kit, you can build the Pylon
`gg-peripheral` app and connect to it from your mac over Bluetooth.  
See [Mynewt Apps](apps/mynewt/mynewt_apps.md) for details on how to run and
configure the `gg-peripheral` app on your board.

### Mobile <-> macOS

If you have an iOS or Android phone, and want to try out one of the mobile
Host Apps ([iOS Host App](apps/ios/host_app.md) and 
[Android Host App](apps/android/host_app.md)) and a mac, 
you can run an instance of the [Stack Tool](tools/stack_tool.md) on the mac, 
as a Peripheral (a.k.a Node in Golden Gate terminology), and use the Host App on
your phone to connect to it.  
In addition you will run a CoAP server on your mac, that the Host App will
make requests to, communicating through the stack tool.

In a first Terminal window, run the CoAP server:
``` bash
$ gg-coap-server
```

In a second Terminal window, run the stack tool in Node mode, configured to act 
as a Bluetooth peripheral, advertising under the name `Jiji` (the default name
used by the stack tool), and forwarding CoAP requests to port 5683 on localhost.
``` bash
$ gg-stack-tool --top coap 127.0.0.1 5683 5684 --bottom bluetooth node node DSNG
```

Now, from either the iOS Host App or Android Host App, scan and find the mac
that is advertising as `Jiji`, connect, and once the connection is established,
send a CoAP request to `/helloworld`

### Mobile <-> Device

If you have an iOS or Android phone, and want to try out one of the mobile
Host Apps ([iOS Host App](apps/ios/host_app.md) and 
[Android Host App](apps/android/host_app.md)), and a Nordic nrf52840-DK 
Development Kit, you can run the `gg-peripheral` app on your board and 
connect to it from your mobile app.

### Device <-> Device

If you have a two Nordic nrf52840-DK Development Kits, you can build both the 
Pylon `gg-central` and `gg-peripheral` apps and connect one to the other.    
See [Mynewt Apps](apps/mynewt/mynewt_apps.md) for details on how to run and
configure the `gg-central` and `gg-peripheral` apps on your board.

What's Next?
